# Time to Die
## Motivation
To create a motivational app that embraces the concept of *memento mori*.
My goal is to remind the user of their eventual expiration date, in order for them to realize that they have one awesome life to live, so they had better get around to living it!

## Setup
The repo is bundled as a standard Android Studio Project. Clone the repo, import the project into Android Studio, and get tinkering!

## What Is *Time to Die*?
*Time to Die* grabs relevant user information in order to calculate how much time they have left to live. The app aims to provide a positive outlook on life, and is meant to encourage the user to not waste their time. This could be a powerful tool to encourage the user to be more [intrinsically motivated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Incentive_theories:_intrinsic_and_extrinsic_motivation).

## How Does It Work?
*Time to Die* will collect the user's current country of residence, their age, and their sex. This information will be used to calculate how much time the user has left to live. A countdown screen will be displayed after the time left has been calculated.
